GenCert Release Notes

	Primary this application was develop for creating certificate request for web 
server with additional subject names. Generated certificate file with .csr extension 
need to be send to internal or external certificate authorities (CA) to generate 
certificate file. This generated certificate file will be merge with certificate 
private key to generate .pfx certificate file for web server.
Certificate file generated on this way with internal or external CA public key 
certificate will be used on web server to provide web server authentication.

	After initial version, I added new option for generating self sign certificate that 
can be generate root CA certificate and other option for generating certificate base on 
date inside certificate request file (.csr).

	This application can be use for practical and educational purpose.
	
	This is Windows Desktop application developed using WPF MahApps and Bouncy Castle PKI library.
	
	Inside release version, you can find folder (DemoCertFiles) with Demo certificate files generated by this application.
